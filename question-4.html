      <h1>Question 4. Why is it important to mark up your content semantically?</h1>
      <p>We talked about this during week 2. Write up your answer below and mark it up with at least one paragraph tag.</p>
      <p>Use the word &ldquo;semantic&rdquo; somewhere in your answer and mark up that word as both strong and emphasized.</p>
      <p>Because it is easier for browsers, developers, and crawlers to distinguish between different types of data.
        All of these <b><u>semantic</u></b> tags make it clearer what information is on the webpage as well as its importance.</p>
